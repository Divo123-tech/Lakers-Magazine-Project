          With the Lakers continuing to struggle, will Pelinka pull the trigger
          on a Russell Westbrook trade despite having to put in their first
          round picks? It has been no secret that the Lakers have been trying to
          shop Russell Westbrook ever since the trade deadline last season.
          While it may have not been an issue last season, the progress of Russ
          as a productive basketball player for the Lakers makes the price of
          two first round picks that much harder to swallow.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The trio of players was originally brought in on the 2021 off-season
          when the Lakers traded Kyle Kuzma, Kentavious Caldwell Pope, Montrez
          Harell and a 2021 first round pick to the Washington Wizards for
          Russell Westbrook and 3 second round picks. The hope was that with
          Russ' proven ability to carry a subpar squad into play off contention,
          Lebron and AD could afford to take time off during the regular season
          to rest for when the playoffs come around. This however was not the
          case, and the lack of shooting, defense, and overall fit caused the
          team to miss the playoffs in Russ' debut season.

          During the controversial season trade rumours swirled around the
          Lakers for quite literally every player on the roster. The most common
          trade target for the Lakers was ofcourse Russell Westbrook, with fans
          begging Rob Pelinka to trade him for anything they could get. The
          other most commonly rumoured player was THT, due to his age and
          tradeable salary. However some fans took it a step further and asked
          to trade Lebron and Anthony Davis, arguing that the Lakers had gotten
          what they needed with those players and that it was time for a
          rebuild.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          That season the Lakers stood pat and didn't trade any players before
          the deadline, opting instead to try and make moves during the summer.
          That summer they fired head coach Frank Vogel and signed rookie head
          coach Darvin Ham. They then traded Talen Horton Tucker and Stanley
          Johnson for veteran Patrick Beverley. Finally, they signed a plethora
          of free agents like Thomas Bryant, Dennis Schroder, and Lonnie Walker.
          Despite the clear improvement from last year's roster, the Lakers are
          still struggling sitting 13th in the highly competitive Western
          Conference. As the trade deadline looms, and with both their first
          round picks still with them, how will they move forward with their big
          3?

          Above you can see the stats of the Lakers' big 3 this season.
          Unfortunately for the trade LeBron crowd, due to his new extension he
          is unable to be traded, and with his MVP level performance this year,
          its unlikely that the Lakers would've traded him anyways.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Anthony Davis, while widely regarded as safe due to his connection
          with LeBron, has had a history of linguring injuries which has limited
          him to only 30 games this season. He is however their defensive anchor
          and helped them win their 2020 title so he can be most likely be ruled
          out of getting traded.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Russ in the other hand we cannot be so sure about. While arguments can
          be made on him staying, whether it be his off the bench production, as
          well as other team's unwillingness to trade fairly with the Lakers for
          him, it is almost a guaruntee that he will leave this season. The
          Lakers will operate as an over the cap team regardless of whether or
          not Russell Westbrook stays or goes, if they want to improve their
          roster, they are going to need his $47 million salary to match
          contracts in trades.
