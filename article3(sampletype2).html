          The trade deadline is getting closer, and the Lakers are in desperate
          need of help, who will stay and who will go? The Lakers have contended
          with top teams in both conferences despite facing injuries and fit
          issues with their guard heavy lineups. While they have pulled the
          trigger on Rui Hachimura, its clear this team needs more help, and
          with those first round picks still being there, who will the Lakers
          trade before the deadline?
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The Lakers have been actively searching for help especially in terms
          of wing depth and shooting. With the acquisition of Rui Hachimura for
          Kendrick Nunn they've managed to restore some balance in their
          guard-heavy roster, however if they want to truly contend, that cannot
          be the only move they make. While the Lakers do not have much in terms
          of assets, they do have 5 players that teams around the league either
          see value in, or just have contracts large enough to bring significant
          return. The most obvious of which is Russell Westbrook.

          Though Russ is definitely the fan favorite to be traded, especially
          since the resurgence of Patrick Beverley, he is not the only person
          that could be traded. If the Lakers were to find themselves stuck, as
          in teams are unwilling to even trade for Russ unless both first round
          picks are included regardless of the quality of return, then they
          might decide to make a move on the margins instead. This would mean
          trading one of their smaller contracts in hope of bringing a role
          player that could fit well with their big 3
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          This would save them some draft compensation as the return they would
          get for these players likely won't be as valuable as it would be if
          they traded for Russ. This could lend them some flexibility in the
          summer as they would then have 3 first round picks to play with.

          Above you can see the stats of the Lakers' 5 most tradeable players.
          First we have the aforementioned Russell Westbrook whose large
          contract could be an avenue for the Lakers to make a splashy moves
          were they to include their 2 first round picks. Next we have Patrick
          Beverley, the Lakers' summer acquisition. While he has been playing
          better, he does have the most tradeable contract, and is on an
          expiring deal. Unfortunately he has very little trade value so he
          would most likely be trade filler
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Now we have Lonnie Walker the IV whose in an interesting position to
          say the least. He is a young athletic wing who can shoot the 3,
          however he is on the last year of his deal, and has just come back
          from a knee injury. His salary is also quite small compared to that of
          Patrick Beverly and Westbrook's. While Walker could be an interesting
          addition to a deal to stack up salaries, its unclear how much other
          teams value him
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Reaves and Christie both if traded can act as sweetener. Their very
          small salary makes them impossible to trade on their own, however, if
          the Lakers were to go for a splashy player, then these two could be
          included along or instead of their picks to sweeten the deal for
          another team due to their youth and potential as 3 and D wings.
