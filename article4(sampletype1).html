            The Lakers fall to the Boston Celtics at the Garden. While it hurts
            more due to the well known rivalry between the two teams, the Los
            Angeles fanbase as well as members of the team and staff are more at
            odds with the calls of the referees. This contempt was especially
            directed towards the final play of the game, where there was a no
            call on Lebron's drive to the rim as Tatum proceded to hack him on
            the arm
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Los Angeles Lakers began a five-game road trip on Friday night,
            looking for revenge against the rival Boston Celtics after losing to
            them in overtime a few weeks ago. It was another overtime game this
            time around with the Lakers getting hosed on a call at the end of
            regulation, a scene all too familiar for L.A. As a result, the
            Lakers suffered a 125-121 defeat.
          </p>
          <br />

              alt="paused image from the live game footage of Tatum's no call foul on Lebron"

            The Lakers stuck with the same starting lineup, which meant that
            Anthony Davis, Rui Hachimura and Lonnie Walker IV all came off the
            bench. L.A.'s starting unit still got off to a quick start though as
            Patrick Beverley hit a 3-pointer and then LeBron James had a pair of
            layups.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With the Lakers trailing by one in the final minute, Beverley hit
            another massive triple, his fourth of the game. Brogdon was then
            fouled and made a pair to tie it at 102 with 41.7 to play. Again, it
            was Beverley that came up huge with a putback dunk, of all things,
            to give L.A. another lead. Brown then missed a wide-open 3, but
            Beverley only made one of two free throws.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            That set up another chance for the Lakers and Brown got an offensive
            rebound and completed a three-point play to tie it with four seconds
            left. James drove to the basket on the final and was hit hard on the
            arm by Tatum, but no foul was called and he missed the layup so the
            game went to overtime.
          </p>
          <br />

              "No doubt we got cheated tonight. Bron got slapped on the arm and
              we didn't get no free throws. Game should've never gotten to OT,
              that's another win robbed from us"
              <br />-Anthony Davis (Postgame Press Conference)

          <br />
          <p>
            Brown started the overtime period hot by going to the basket,
            looking for more foul calls which he got. He then hit a 3 to put his
            team up by six, forcing a Lakers timeout.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            After not playing the whole fourth quarter, Westbrook came back in
            and immediately made an impact with a putback. He then drew a
            flagrant 1 foul on Brogdon to get the Lakers within three. Brown
            came up with another big bucket, however, and then made a pair of
            free throws after a James layup. The Lakers played hard until the
            end but ultimately could not come up with enough stops to make a
            comeback.
