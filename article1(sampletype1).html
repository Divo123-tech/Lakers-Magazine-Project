              After the controversial loss against Boston, the Lakers continue
              their roadtrip against a short-handed Nets team without Lebron and
              Anthony Davis. Irving and the Nets got off to a hot start with
              some early 3-pointers to take a 15-6 lead. Outside of a couple of
              early buckets from Rui Hachimura, who was getting his first start
              since joining the team, the Lakers were very cold early. The Nets
              seemed to be in complete control of the game until a quick run by
              the Lakers gave them a small lead in the third quarter. Outside of
              Westbrook though, the Lakers really struggled offensively with a
              season-low for points in the first quarter, trailing 29-16.

            <p>
              Things didnt change much for the Lakers in the second quarter with
              them continuing to struggle to put the ball in the basket.
              Meanwhile, Yuta Watanabe had seven quick points to extend
              Brooklyns lead to 19. The Lakers began to claw their way back in
              it in the second half of the second quarter. Westbrook continued
              to find teammates for open looks and Troy Brown Jr. finally hit a
              3 to cut the deficit to 12 going into the halftime locker room at
              58-46. Thomas Bryant made his presence known to begin the third
              quarter with a putback three-point play to get the Lakers back
              within single digits. Hachimura then hit a 3 while Brown and
              Bryant scored, all of a sudden getting the Lakers back within two
              and forcing a Nets timeout. After a slow start to the game, Dennis
              Schroder finally got going in the third quarter with a four-point
              play to keep the Laker run going and regain the lead momentarily
              before Irving ended it by responding with a 3. While Bryant hit a
              3 of his own, he also had a pair of silly lapses in judgment when
              he was called for goaltending not once but twice in a minute span.

              Westbrook continued to find teammates for open looks and Troy
              Brown Jr. finally hit a 3 to cut the deficit to 12 going into the

              start to the game, Dennis Schroder finally got going in the third
              quarter with a four-point play to keep the Laker run going and
              regain the lead momentarily before Irving ended it by responding

              Cam Thomas played a big role in that run and then hit another 3
              early in the fourth to extend the Nets lead to eight. Things began
              to spiral from there with the Lakers struggling on both ends, and
              that includes rebounding. Brooklyn worked its lead to 14 midway
              through the quarter, prompting Darvin Ham to go with an
              ultra-small lineup as a last-ditch effort. That actually worked
              for a little bit as the Lakers cut their deficit in half before
              Brooklyn responded with five straight points to effectively close
              the game out. Irving beat the shot clock with a corner 3 to
              officially put the dagger in L.A.
