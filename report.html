    <h1>Report</h1>
    <h2>Cristopher Meidivo Harsono</h2>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The essential story being told by the website leans more toward the fan
      made element of a magazine/newsletter. When I was researching possible
      magazine websites to emulate I found myself dissatisfied by the very
      professional looking, fashion, high society type websites and found myself
      gravitating more towards colorful and flashy fan made websites. This
      website tells the story of an organization started by only a handful of
      passionate fans that got lucky enough to find reporters that can talk
      directly to the team, writers who work right as the news drops, and a
      single web developer who makes the website for free and out of their own
      passion. That last one you could say was also inspired by this real life
      situation. The structure was very simple, it would be a homepage that was
      capable of reaching nearly every page in the website. It tells the story
      of the site, the team, and incentivizes the visitor to subscribe. Each
      part of the website emphasizes a different element of Javascript and CSS,
      whether it be closure functions, handlebars, DOM manipulation, bootstrap
      grid, flexbox, animation, and more. The idea was to make the website more
      than just articles but instead have different parts that would be
      applicable to a fan made site like the one I made.
    </p>

    <h3>Inspiration</h3>
    <p>
      There were two major sites that inspired the way I made my website and
      that was the lakersnation.com website, and the silverscreenandroll.com
      website. As a Lakers fan I have been following both these sites and was
      greatly inspired by how it was able to balance professionalism and fun.
      The websites are colorful, interactive, with art in numerous places, and
      yet it still looks like a real website that serves its purpose of updating
      viewers with the latest information regarding the Los Angeles Lakers. I
      especially followed their color schemes, and navigation ideas. I used some
      of the Lakers Nation articles list ideas, as well as some of their
      formats. Furthermore, the official NBA.com website was also inspirational
      to me, as they also have a list of articles and yet their website provides
      information through a variety of other means, something I took to heart
      through the addition of the “draft page”.
    </p>

    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
    <p>
      I made sure to use specific semantic elements in my HTML page to their
      fullest abilities in order to help screen readers better identify those
      sections to those who are visually impaired. For example I included the
      semantic elements: header, nav, footer, and section just to list a few.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I also added aria-labels to certain parts of the website that would be
      more difficult for screen readers to read such as the navigation bar. I
      gave 'for' values in the sign up form to help screen readers read the
      purposes of the inputs. I specified the language of the html page in the
      html tag to english to help clarify to international readers.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Finally, I gave descriptive alt tags to <strong>all</strong> pictures
      including the ones used in the handlebars sections. There were alot of
      pictures used and as is the nature of articles/magazines these pictures
      are widely important. These alt tags will again help those who are
      visually impaired know about the picture through the use of a screen
      reader, or if for some reason the picture is unable to be accessed by the
      client's device, it will give a description of what should be there.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Usability</h3>
    <p>
      One of the things I most considered in terms of usability was the ease of
      traversing through the website from each and every page. In the home page
      the visitor is able to go through every page whether through the
      navigation bar, which highlights the current page you are on, the news
      footer which shows random articles and takes you straight to the article
      you click on, or the subscribe button which takes you to the sign up form.
      The articles all have links in the top left corner which allow them to go
      back to either the Latest on Lakers page or back to the home page. The
      news footer also appears in every part of the site except for the Latest
      on Lakers page as it seemed redundant. This helps in guiding the visitor
      to the articles section of the website.
    </p>

    <br />
    <p>
      Another aspect of usability is the responsiveness of the website. While it
      is incredibly difficult and tedious to account for literally every screen
      size, I feel confident in saying that I did a relatively good job
      accounting for my screen size and all those below it. Those who are using
      tablets and phones will have a responsive collapsible navbar, adjusted
      text and image sizes, as well as adjusted displays for the news footer,
      Latest On Lakers page, and draft page.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Finally, a lot of the interactables are incredibly intuitive due to the
      use of the hover pseudo selector in CSS, all buttons, navigable links, and
      clickable widgets show their usability through changing color and or size
      when hovered upon. This greatly increases the ease of figuring how to
      traverse the site and use its intended features.
    </p>

    <h3>Learning</h3>
    <p>
      I had to learn how to use Handlebars to make this website as it would not
      just make my life easier through the convenience that templating engines
      provide, but also because it was part of the rubric and an essential part
      of client side development. I had a hard time following the coursera
      videos, so after some private learning with my professors during his
      office hours as well as self research with some Youtube videos, I was able
      to not just figure it out but leverage its abilities to make neater more
      expandable components in my website.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In learning Handlebars, I also naturally had to learn DOM manipulation. If
      I wanted to use Handlebars I would have to know how to use Javascript to
      manipulate the target HTML page. While the videos helped, I actually took
      an external online course titled “The Complete Web Developer in 2023: Zero
      To Mastery” in Udemy by Andrei Neagoie. This helped me learn how to
      leverage getting different elements in the DOM and using them as variables
      for further manipulation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Finally, I learned about the different aspects of accessibility that I did
      not learn or use in the last project. I had to learn through different
      blogs, newsletters and posts about not just the importance of accessible
      design, but also how to achieve it. I learned about aria-labels,
      accessible HTML semantics, and the alt property for images. All these were
      used liberally in my site to help make it more accessible.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Evaluation I</h3>
    <p>
      One of the most successful parts of the project was the incorporation of
      Handlebars with DOM manipulation to have a cleaner and tidier HTML page.
      Instead of laboring to copy and paste code to manually reuse templates for
      different pieces of information, I learned to use a templating engine like
      Handlebars to do it for me. This especially came in handy with the nature
      of a magazine site. The news footer, our team section, Latest On Lakers
      page, and carousel are just some of the examples of how Handlebars really
      made life easier, and my HTML neater through the use of for loops,
      templating and DOM manipulation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I also used a lot of different ways to make CSS layouts. In this project I
      was able to use display grid, flex, and none. I was also able to
      incorporate bootstrap's grid system, as well as use things like absolute
      and relative positioning. While we learnt this in the previous group
      project, I did find that my ability and confidence to use these tools are
      a lot greater now than it was before. This helped make an interesting
      layout that fit my website's theme and follows responsive behavior.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Finally, I believe my use of Javascript logic in the website made for an
      interactive website that also displayed my programming skill and
      knowledge. I traversed complex data structures, used nested for loops, and
      made closure functions all of which were not trivial but actually played a
      big role in the functionality of the website. I also used the new ES6
      syntax such as the arrow functions and “for of” loops where appropriate.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>Evaluation II</h3>
    <p>
      The biggest area of improvement is definitely my creativity in terms of
      design. I have never been a very artsy person, and so the idea of color
      theory, symmetrical proportions, and things of that nature never really
      clicked for me. I used a standard Lakers color palette, made a standard
      layout for most of my pages, and didn't do anything extraordinarily
      creative. I made this website how I view myself personally, it doesn't
      dabble in the creative, but it gets the job done. I believe my website
      does what it needs to do, but fails artistically next to a site with a
      more gifted designer. Next time I would definitely try to be more creative
      and just unique with my different layouts, designs, and color choices
      instead of sticking to what is “safe”.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      I also believe my website could be more accessible, and more responsive.
      Unfortunately one person cannot account for all the different screen sizes
      and how the website would respond to each of them. I mostly accounted for
      responsiveness from my 15.6 inch screen and under, however I realize that
      now websites are able to be opened on larger desktops and things of that
      nature. Next time I will definitely try and accommodate for those larger
      screen sizes.
